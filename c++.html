                    <li id="xyz">The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li  class="uvw">C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It may be a collection of commands,<br> 
                        which tell the pc to try to do “something.” This collection of commands is typically called C++<br>
                        ASCII text files.</li><br>
                    <li class="uvw">C++ could also be a problem-oriented language that’s much easier to use than the other <br>
                        low-level like binary coding. It takes much more space than low-level languages but it’s much easier<br>
                        to understand and learn.</li><br>
                    <li class="uvw">C++ program has many advantages when it involves programming, All C++ program stand-alone<br>
                        files must use the foremost function to allow the program to start out up and motivate its functions.</li><br>
                    <li class="uvw">C++ program can support unions and structures that are a mix of stand-alone and put-together<br>
                        files,It uses the standard C++ application mentioned as “.cpp”, C++ uses the reserved library word<br> 
                        mentioned as “goto” that’s the same as Java’s continue, or break commands.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li  class="uvw">One major problem in C++ is when the info points to an equivalent thing from two different<br>
                         starting points, this causes a serious problem, the C++ program will still have involved problems within<br> 
                         the coding.</li><br>
                    <li class="uvw">Java’s uni-code to the ASCII rules is 16-bit, while C++ program is 8-bit only, So, C++ may be a<br> 
                        less impressive programming language but saves the memory.</li><br>
                    <li class="uvw">C++ program is complex during a very large high-level program, C++ is employed for platform-<br>
                        specific application commonly, For the actual OS or platform, the library set is typically chosen.</li><br>
                    <li class="uvw">C++ program can’t support garbage pickup, It’s not secure because it’s a pointer, friend<br> 
                        function, and global variable and it’s no support for threads built-in.</li>
